# Dmenu for easily finding a manual to open from a list of all manuals.

# Set a character width for this script if needed:
#export MANWIDTH=80

man $(apropos --long . | dmenu -i -l 30 | awk '{print $2, $1}' | tr -d '()')

# Probably the most useful script ever.

# There are some manuals that have the same name but different sections denoted
# with what's inside (), one useful section to know is the POSIX version of the
# manuals which are #p or #posix, so adding that to the search shows you the
# POSIX version of the manual if it exists. For more information read the
# initial part of the man-pages manual and search 'intro' with this script.
#
# Keep in mind that newly installed programs with man pages tend not to appear
# right away because the manual database hasn't been updated yet (though you
# can simply write the name of the package if you know it). Depending on the
# system, it may be updated with a cron job, during boot, etc. If you want
# to update it manually, run:
#
#   sudo mandb
#
# Ideally it would run every time a program is installed/uninstalled, but it
# seems a pain to set it up. It takes a few seconds to finish, which is a
# bummer, because I would have just put it at the start of this script. I could
# also just make a wrapper script for pacman that runs "sudo mandb" quietly if
# the un/installation was completed successfully.
